# dgraphs
Code for making nice graphs for eta-earth paper.

Run it from a shell to get the options.
Alternatively, import the variables and functions with `from dgraphs import *` from this directory. This is mostly useful for debugging, but might be nice for some applications.

To quickly regenerate all the graphs for a mission concept, run `./genXXXXX.sh`.
